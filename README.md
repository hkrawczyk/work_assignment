# Description

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20. for sake of Onwelo assignment.
The idea was to prepare simple Bookmarks application that uses store and forms.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` or `npm build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.


## Nice to have
For sake of further development and further optimisation I would recommend to implement store cache in `localStorage`


## Warning
If command line will show vulnerabilities on `npm audit` actions listed below are necessary:

`rm -r node_modules`

`npx npm-force-resolutions`

`npm install`
